Meet **OMNINUM**, a sleek and innovative text-based calculator that goes far beyond simple arithmetic. This React-powered application redefines what a calculator can be by combining mathematical computations with productivity features in a beautiful, terminal-inspired interface.

## ðŸš€ What Makes OMNINUM Special?

### Smart Mathematical Processing
OMNINUM leverages the powerful `mathsteps` library to not just calculate results, but to show you the journey. When solving equations (those containing 'x'), it provides step-by-step breakdowns, making it perfect for students and anyone wanting to understand the mathematical process.

    codeInstances={[
  {
    code:
`Input: 2x + 5 = 15
Output: 
Step 1: 2x + 5 = 15
Step 2: 2x = 10  
Step 3: x = 5`,
    language: "text",
    label: "Example"
  }
]} />

For regular expressions, it simplifies them intelligently, handling everything from basic arithmetic to complex mathematical operations.

### Beyond Calculations: The "Roombuds" Feature
What sets OMNINUM apart is its hidden productivity suite called "Roombuds" - a collection of tools designed for shared living and collaboration:

#### ðŸ“± Smart Contacts Manager
- Store contact information with phone numbers and banking details 
- One-click copying to clipboard for quick sharing
- Perfect for roommates who need to split bills or share contact info

#### ðŸ“‹ Papers & Documents
- Quick access to important documents and papers
- Organized storage for shared household information

#### ðŸ’° Savings Tracker
- Monitor shared expenses and savings goals
- Ideal for roommate financial planning

### Elegant User Experience
The application features a minimalist, terminal-inspired design built with:
- **React 17** for robust component architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** for beautiful, responsive styling
- **Heroicons** for clean, modern iconography

The interface centers around a simple input field with a chevron prompt (>) that accepts natural language commands like "help", "roombuds", or mathematical expressions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Architecture

The codebase demonstrates excellent React patterns:
- **Component-based architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- **State management** using React hooks
- **Conditional rendering** for dynamic feature activation
- **Responsive design** that works across devices

Key technologies:

## ðŸŒŸ What's Next?

The roadmap shows ambitious plans:
- **Currency conversion** for international calculations
- **Todo list integration** for enhanced productivity
- **Landing page** for better user onboarding

## Why OMNINUM Matters

In an era of specialized apps, OMNINUM takes a refreshing approach by combining calculation power with everyday productivity tools. It's particularly valuable for:

- **Students** who need step-by-step math solutions
- **Anyone who appreciates clean, efficient interfaces** inspired by terminal aesthetics

The project showcases how modern web technologies can create tools that are both powerful and approachable, proving that calculators don't have to be boring single-purpose applications.

OMNINUM represents the future of computational tools - smart, integrated, and designed for real-world use cases beyond just numbers.
