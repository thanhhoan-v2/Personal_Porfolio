## üöÄ Project Overview

The **Sorting Visualizer** is a Next.js-based web application that provides real-time visual representations of five fundamental sorting algorithms:

- **Bubble Sort** - Simple comparison-based algorithm with O(n¬≤) complexity
- **Quick Sort** - Efficient divide-and-conquer with O(n log n) average complexity  
- **Merge Sort** - Stable divide-and-conquer with guaranteed O(n log n) complexity
- **Selection Sort** - In-place selection with O(n¬≤) complexity
- **Insertion Sort** - Adaptive algorithm perfect for small datasets

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

The project leverages a powerful modern web development stack:
- **Next.js 15.2.0** with App Router and Turbopack for lightning-fast development
- **React 19** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations
- **Radix UI** components for accessible, unstyled primitives

## üé® Key Features

1. **Real-Time Visualization**
The `Visualization.tsx` component renders an array of bars with dynamic heights, where:
- **Red bars** indicate elements currently being compared
- **Gray bars** show elements being processed
- **Green bars** represent the final sorted state
- **Animated arrows** point to elements being compared

2. **Interactive Controls**
- **Algorithm Selector**: Choose from 5 different sorting algorithms
- **Speed Control**: Adjust animation speed with an intuitive slider (üê¢ to üêÜ)
- **Play/Pause**: Start and stop sorting with beautiful dock-style controls

3. **Educational Information**
Each algorithm includes detailed information accessible via a modal dialog:
- Algorithm description and how it works
- Time complexity analysis
- Space complexity breakdown

4. **Responsive Design**
The interface adapts beautifully across devices with:
- Flexible bar visualization that scales to viewport
- Mobile-friendly controls
- Dark/light theme support via `next-themes`

## üí° Implementation Highlights

1. **Smart State Management**
The app uses React hooks effectively to manage:
- Array state with real-time updates
- Sorting status and interruption controls
- Visual indicators for comparing elements
- Speed controls with dynamic delay calculation

2. **Elegant UI Components**
The project uses a sophisticated dock component at the bottom, similar to macOS, providing:
- Play/pause functionality with icon transitions
- Algorithm information access
- Smooth hover animations and tooltips
